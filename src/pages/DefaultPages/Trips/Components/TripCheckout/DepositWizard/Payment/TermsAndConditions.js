    <h4>Cancellation Policy*:</h4>
    <p>If you cancel 65 days or more before your trip, you'll get a refund less a fee of USD $50. If you cancel between 46 and 65 days before your trip, you'll get a refund less a fee of USD $100. If you cancel within 45 days of your trip, your trip will not be refunded. All fees are on a per-person basis.</p>
    <p>*This cancellation policy is subject to rules and regulations in applicable jurisdictions in which our travel supplier is based. Therefore, in the event of conflict between the cancellation policy displayed here and cancellation terms in supplier booking terms, the provisions of the booking terms will prevail.</p>
    <h4>Name Change Policy:</h4>
    <p>If you change any name(s) on your booking 45 days or more before the start date of your trip, there will be no fee for the name change(s). If you change any name(s) on your booking 44 to 31 days before the start date of your trip, you'll be charged a fee of USD $50 per name change. Name changes are not permitted within 30 days of the start date of your trip.</p>
    <p>In the unfortunate event that an activity or excursion is no longer available, we will substitute a similar activity of equal or greater value.</p>
    <h4>Make sure that your passport and visa, if applicable, are up-to-date before you leave!</h4>
    <p>It's important to double check that you have all the identification and other documentation required by the specific country you're traveling to. In many countries, passports and visas must be valid for 6 months or longer after the trip end date. If you are unable to obtain the required identification and other documentation, the Cancellation Policy for this Escape Trip will apply.</p>
    <p>Make sure that you request a name change or room change at least 31 or more days before the 1st day of your trip. Due to contractual supplier policies, we may not be able to confirm requested name or room changes to existing bookings for trips that are scheduled to travel within 30 days of your request.</p>
    <p>Each individual, including each child, who is coming along with you on your Escape Trip is required to have a booking prior to the commencement of the trip. If you do not book and pay for each such person in advance of the trip, you will be charged the hotel's then-current rate, not the trip price, for each such person at the time of your check-in.</p>
    <p>Pricing for children is based on their age at the time of travel and may be subject to additional terms and conditions of individual hotels and all-inclusive resorts. Also, pricing for children can vary, and may be higher than pricing for adults. Therefore, before you book any travel, please check the relevant hotel or resort website for applicable terms and conditions as well as details regarding their pricing structure.</p>
    <p>Pricing shown is for each person, and is based on 2 adults per room.</p>
    <p>Please don't consider your change requests official until you receive a confirmation email from us.</p>
